QoS Tree Configuration
----------------------

The QoS implementation allows for an abstracted tree of scheduler nodes
represented in device tree form.  For example:

  +-----------+
  |  inputs   |  . . .
  +-----------+              +-----------+        +-----------+
        |       |      |     |  inputs   |        |  inputs   |
        +-------+------+     +-----------+        +-----------+
                |                  |                    |
        +--------------+   +---------------+    +--------------+
        |     prio 0   |   |    prio 1     |    |    prio 2    |
        |   unordered  |   |    inputs     |    |    inputs    |
        +--------------+   +---------------+    +--------------+
                |                 |                    |
                +-----------------+--------------------+
                                  |
                        +--------------------+
                        |  strict prio node  |
                        +--------------------+
                                  |

At each node, shaping and dropping parameters may be specified, within limits
of the constraints outlined in this document.  The following sections detail
the device tree attributes applicable for this implementation.

QoS Node Attributes
-------------------

The following attributes are recognized within QoS configuration nodes:

  - "strict-priority" and "weighted-round-robin"

    e.g. strict-priority;

    This attribute specifies the type of scheduling performed at a node.  It
    is an error to specify both of these attributes in a particular node.  The
    absence of both of these attributes defaults the node type to unordered
    (first come first serve).

  - "weight"

    e.g. weight = <80>;

    This attribute specifies the weight attached to the child node of a
    weighted-round-robin node.  It is an error to specify this attribute on a
    node whose parent is not a weighted-round-robin node.

  - "priority"

    e.g. priority = <1>;

    This attribute specifies the priority attached to the child node of a
    strict-priority node.  It is an error to specify this attribute on a
    node whose parent is not a strict-priority node.  It is also an error for
    child nodes of a strict-priority node to have the same priority specified.

  - "byte-units" or "packet-units"

    e.g. byte-units;

    The presence of this attribute indicates that the scheduler accounts for
    traffic in byte or packet units.  If this attribute is not specified for a
    given node, the accounting mode is inherited from its parent node.  If
    this attribute is not specified for the root node, the accounting mode
    defaults to byte units.

  - "output-rate"

    e.g. output-rate = <31250000 25000>;

    The first element of this attribute specifies the output shaped rate in
    bytes/second or packets/second (depending on the accounting mode for the
    node).  If this attribute is absent, it defaults to infinity (i.e., no
    shaping).

    The second element of this attribute specifies the maximum accumulated
    credits in bytes or packets (depending on the accounting mode for the
    node).  If this attribute is absent, it defaults to infinity (i.e.,
    accumulate as many credits as possible).

  - "overhead-bytes"

    e.g. overhead-bytes = <24>;

    This attribute specifies a per-packet overhead (in bytes) applied in the
    byte accounting mode.  This can be used to account for framing overhead
    on the wire.  This attribute is inherited from parent nodes if absent.
    If not defined for the root node, a default value of 24 will be used.
    This attribute is passed through by inheritence (but ignored) on packet
    accounted nodes.

  - "output-queue"

    e.g. output-queue = <645>;

    This specifies the QMSS queue on which output packets are pushed.  This
    attribute must be defined only for the root node in the qos tree.  Child
    nodes in the tree will ignore this attribute if specified.

  - "input-queues"

    e.g. input-queues = <8010 8065>;

    This specifies a set of ingress queues that feed into a QoS node.
    This attribute must be defined only for leaf nodes in the QoS tree.
    Specifying input queues on non-leaf nodes is treated as an error.
    The absence of input queues on a leaf node is also treated as an error.

  - "stats-class"

    e.g. stats-class = "linux-best-effort";

    The stats-class attribute ties one or more input stage nodes to a set of
    traffic statistics (forwarded/discarded bytes, etc.).  The system has a
    limited set of statistics blocks (up to 48), and an attempt to exceed this
    count is an error.  This attribute is legal only for leaf nodes, and a
    stats-class attribute on an intermediate node will be treated as an error.

  - "drop-policy"

    e.g. drop-policy = "no-drop"

    The drop-policy attribute specifies a drop policy to apply to a QoS
    node (tail drop, random early drop, no drop, etc.) when the traffic
    pattern exceeds specifies parameters.  The drop-policy parameters are
    configured separately within device tree (see "Traffic Police Policy
    Attributes section below).  This attribute defaults to "no drop" for
    applicable input stage nodes.

    If a node in the QoS tree specifies a drop-policy, it is an error if
    any of its descendent nodes (children, children of children, ...) are of
    weighted-round-robin or strict-priority types.


1.5 Traffic Police Policy Attributes
------------------------------------

The following attributes are recognized within traffic drop policy nodes:

  - "byte-units" or "packet-units"

    e.g. byte-units;

    The presence of this attribute indicates that the dropr accounts for
    traffic in byte or packet units.  If this attribute is not specified, it
    defaults to byte units.  Policies that use random early drop must be of
    byte unit type.

  - "limit"

    e.g. limit = <10000>;

    Instantaneous queue depth limit (in bytes or packets) at which tail drop
    takes effect.  This may be specified in combination with random early
    drop, which operates on average queue depth (instead of instantaneous).
    The absence of this attribute, or a zero value for this attribute disables
    tail drop behavior.

  - "random-early-drop"

    e.g. random-early-drop = <32768 65536 2 2000>;

    The random-early-drop attribute specifies the following four parameters
    in order:

      - low threshold:	No packets are dropped when the average queue depth is
			below this threshold (in bytes). This parameter must
			be specified.

      - high threshold:	All packets are dropped when the average queue depth
			above this threshold (in bytes). This parameter is
			optional, and defaults to twice the low threshold.

      - max drop probability: the maximum drop probability

      - half-life:	Specified in milli seconds. This is used to calculate
			the average queue depth. This parameter
			is optional and defaults to 2000.


Internally Calculated
---------------------
 - throttle rate - might want to provide device tree override as well
 - wrr/sp/be queue counts
 - egress queue number (except final output)
 - RNG seeds
